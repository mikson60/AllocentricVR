# AllocentricVR

This project was created during the "Introduction to Computational Neuroscience" in 2020, to compare egocentric vs allocentric task solving in virtual reality.

# Experiments

The project involves 4 experiments: a hand held maze, a real life scale maze, a controller for getting the video feed of the Vive Pro headset's frontal camera and a controller for getting the video feed of a webcamera.
